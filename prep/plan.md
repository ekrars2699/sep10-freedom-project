| Alialrida | I like your background color;the green gives it a rightful taste as green means good and I like how you incoperated digital 3d and allowed others to play around with it. | I think you just need to make the font pixel size for the paragraphs slightly bigger but overall don't give up and you wil have good beyond mvp. |
