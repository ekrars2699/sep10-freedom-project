| Alialrida | I like your background color;the green gives it a rightful taste as green means good and I like how you incoperated digital 3d and allowed others to play around with it. | I think you just need to make the font pixel size for the paragraphs slightly bigger but overall don't give up and you wil have good beyond mvp. |

| Cammi | I like your responsive navbar that is fixed on top | You should consider using an component that can organize your chunks of writing, like listgroup to condense your content.

| Leo  |  I like how you explain your  future technolgoy and presenyt techonolgy very well | A grow is that you should add detail to your A-frame because i didnt understand a blue square

|  Edward  |  I like how you went deep into your topic. I also like how informative your website is, talking about stuff like the power encloure and explaning what it is.  |  A grow is that you should look at how your website looks when on a tablet screen size, it doesn't exactly all  fit onto the screen. Also your aframe kind of confused me, I don't really get what the square was meant to show.
