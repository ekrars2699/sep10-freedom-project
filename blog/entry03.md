# Brainstorming Part B
For this section of the Freedom Project we had to brainstorm ideas for future technologies in the subject we decided. These future inventions could be possible solutions to problems in our subject or improving things in field. In order to brainstorm for my subject, forensic science, I had decided to look at the that technologies currently exist today. I had decided to look at current technologies because I could use those to figure out what inventions don't exist currently and inventions that could improve on the current technologies. One of my inventions I thought of is a All In One Evidence Preservation Machine, this machine combines multiple current machines that preserve evidence. I had decided that this invention was nessecary because while I was researching I had found that there are many machines that are used just to preserve evidence without damaging it, I had thought this invention would be a great way to save costs and a great way to oranize evidence. Another invention I had is, Ai Assisted DNA Analysis, currently Ai is becoming more and more involved in our lives and Ai is able to be a great tool to be used alongside people. I had decided that Ai is a great tool to help prevent any human error which would speed up the process of things such as DNA analysis.

# Finalizing Content for the Website
While throughout this project I had reasearched a variety of topics for my website I had to then finalize all the information so it's ready to be put on the actual website.
