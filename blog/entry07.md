## Content
I have finished my year long "Freedom Project" so I had to present it twice, once to my class and the second at an expo. For the presentation, I had made slides which details the process of making my website. My slides have a hook, a demo of my website, challenges I had while making it and lastly key takeaways. During the in class presentation, I made sure that I was loud enough to be heard and that I properly explained my website. In order to prepare for this presentation I made a plan of what I really wanted to tell my audience. I first made an interesting hook that would interest my viewers which was 'Imagine your a detective at a crime scene. How will you gather and analyze evidence?'.
