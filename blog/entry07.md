## Content
I have finished my year long "Freedom Project" so I had to present it twice, once to my class and the second at an expo. For the presentation, I had made slides which details the process of making my website. My slides have a hook, a demo of my website, challenges I had while making it and lastly key takeaways. During the in class presentation, I made sure that I was loud enough to be heard and that I properly explained my website. In order to prepare for this presentation I made a plan of what I really wanted to tell my audience. I first made an interesting hook that would interest my viewers which was 'Imagine your a detective at a crime scene. How will you gather and analyze evidence?'. 

During my presentation I made sure to speak loudly and clearly. I recieved some feedback from my teacher, Mr. Mueller, it was to speak more clearly and slower also my conclusion for my presentation was too vague. I needed to make my conclusion more specific. Next time I'll make sure to take that feedback into consideration. I was too focused on speaking loud enough and to explain other parts of my presentation. Next time I'll speak clearer so that everyone can understand all of my different points. I'll also make my conclusion to include specific takeaways that I had during the creation of my website.

For the expo, I had to make my presentation shorter as it was a less formal event. I had to quickly summarize all the points I had during my first presentation. This was a bit difficult for me because I sometimes took too long during practice but during the actual expo I think I explained my points that I wanted and showed off my website a good amount. 

## Engineering Design Process
I need to improve my website as there are still a lot more that I want to add in ordre to improve my website. I want to add more future inventions and make an A-Frame model out of them. I would also want to add more cards to my website. Also during future presentations I need to make sure I speak more clearly so that I'm fully understood.

## Skills
I used the skill of communication for my presentation. I made sure to speak loud enough so that everyon understood what I am saying. I often have a problem of not being loud enough so I made sure everyone understood me. I used communication to improve my public speaking skills during my presentation.
