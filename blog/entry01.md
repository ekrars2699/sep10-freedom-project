# Entry 1: My Topic: Forensic Science
##### 10/7/24

## Choosing forensic science
Science has always been an interest in my life. While I had heard of this topic before my interest in forensic science began in my freshman year of high school, at the time I had to choose an elective for next year, and forensic science was an option. After that, I did some research on the topic, and while Im not in the class now, I'm still interested in learning more about the topic.

Some of the sources I used while researching the topic are. [Modern Forensic Technology](https://online.campbellsville.edu/criminal-justice/modern-forensic-technology/) and [What is Forensic Science?](https://www.aafs.org/careers-forensic-science/what-forensic-science).

## Engineering Design Process
I am currently in the first two steps of the Engineering Design Process: (Step 1) Defining and (Step 2) Research. First is defining the problem; there are many people who don't know what forensic scientists exactly do or how they even do their job. The next step in the process is researching the problem, researching the technologies that make it possible for forensic scientists to do their jobs.

## Skills
Two skills I had learned are **How to Google** and **How to Read**.

#### How to Google
While figuring out what topic to choose for this project, I had to search for articles that would explain the tasks done in forensic science and the technologies used in it. In order to find out what I was looking for out of the many results, I had to search "technology used in forensic science."

#### How to Read
I had to read multiple articles in order to determine what topic I wanted to choose. I had to closely read these articles to see if they interested me. For forensic science, I looked at all the different things forensic scientists do. I also looked at all the different technologies involved. There were multiple times I had to look up what an abbreviation in the article means or I searched up a specific technology in the article to better understand it.
