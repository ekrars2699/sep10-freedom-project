## Tools For my Freedom Project
For my freedom project I needed to decide on a tool that we would use in order to make our website. There was a list of various tools that have various difficulty levels for use. Through tinkering with the tools I had eventually decided on the tool that I would stick with in order to learn it. 

## Aframe
For my project I had decided to pick the tool, [Aframe](https://aframe.io/). Aframe is a simple program that can be used to make 3d models using code. I had decided to use Aframe because I believe that I can use it to make models of possible future inventions for forensic scientists to use.
