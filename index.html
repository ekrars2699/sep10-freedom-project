        <h1> Forensic Science</h1>
        <h1> Overview </h1>
           <p>  Forensic science is a subject that is very important to our world today. Forensic science is used to analyze evidence from crime scenes. This analysis of evidence is crucial in solving crimes, forensic scientists analyze both physical and digital evidence. These scientists have a variety of different technologies that help them preserve and do different kinds of analysis on the evidence, while being safe from any possible harmful properties from the evidence. Forensic science requires a lot of different equipment in order to successfully do its task, this website will explain the uses of a variety of technologies that are used in forensic science. This site will also have possible future technologies that could exist in the future which would greatly benefit the field of forensic science.</p>

   <h1> Current Physical Evidence </h1>
           <p> <a href="https://www.excedr.com/blog/lab-equipment-list-for-forensic-analysis"> The Centrifuge:</a>
            One of the equipment listed are  Centrifuges, which freezes body fluids such as blood. This is mainly used to preserve biological evidence.
            <a href="https://customfabricators.net/laboratory/forensic-science-lab-equipment/">The Power Enclosure:</a>
            One lab equipment used is the fentanyl hood/ power enclosure. This is used for substance handling. This device is used to contain and protect its users from hazardous powder.
            <a href="https://customfabricators.net/fume-hoods/">Fume Hoods:</a>
            Fume hoods are very important for safety. They’re used to protect people from harmful chemicals and gasses while evidence is being examined.
            Evidence drying cabinets are another tool used to preserve evidence. They’re used to store and dry wet evidence without changing biological evidence.
            <a href="https://www.detectachem.com product-info/mobile-detect/">Mobile Detect Pouch:</a>
            The Mobile Detect pouch is a variety of field kits used for a variety of purposes such as a variety of drug tests, explosive tests, etc.

            https://www.sleuthkit.org/index.php"> Autopsy and Sleuth Kit:</a>
            The Autopsy and The Sleuth Kit are both open source software used in forensic science for various things.
            Autopsy is used to analyze hard drives and phones.
            The Sleuth Kit are tools used to do things such as analyze images and recover files. The Sleuth Kit is also used in other forensic science tools.
           <a href="https://www.mobiledit.com/app-mobiledit "></a> MOBILedit App — MOBILedit:
            An app used to copy/clone data from a phone to another device. It is used to copy a person's data from their phone in order to analyze it.
            <a href="https://www.visionations.com/crimepad_investigators">CrimePad:</a>
            An app used to log and categorize evidence and information.

   <h1> Future Technology </h1>
           <p> Automatic chemical scanner:
            The scanner would scans chemicals in order to identify them.
            The scanner makes sure that the chemicals in the crime scene aren’t dangerous before any people interact with them.
            All in one evidence preservation machine:
            Currently there are multiple machines that are used to preserve evidence. This machine will preserve all evidence in one machine instead of multiple machines.


            This would keep all the evidence for one crime in one area making it more organized.
            This would also save money because then labs would not need to buy different machines to preserve liquids, dry evidence, etc.
            AI assisted DNA analysis
            AI would help match DNA from evidence in crime scenes,
            DNA analysis can take a long time and with AI helping this could drastically decrease this time.
