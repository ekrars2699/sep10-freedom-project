# SEP10 Freedom Project
by **Ekrar Shahrear**

## Context
I am a student at [HSTAT](https://www.hstat.org/) in the [Software Engineering Program](https://hstatsep.github.io/). The "Freedom Project" for SEP10 is a year-long project all about making a website that informs the viewer of the current and future innovations in the topic of my choosing.

For my project, I chose the topic of **Forensic Science**. 

I used HTML, CSS, Bootstrap, and Github. I also chose to independently study Forensic Science in order to help me make my website. My website is able to inform the viewer of many various things about forensic science such as technologies that are currently in use by forensic scientists. On my website I'v also made possible future inventions for forensic scientists to use. During the "Freedom Project" I learned a tool called A-Frame to help me better show my ideas for future inventions.

My blog shows the steps of learning and making my website. My blog starts from the start of the "Freedom Project" where I choose my topic and learn more about it, to the end of the project where I even presented my website. This blog shows my entire process of how my website ended up the way it is now.

## Implications
##### PROS
* Informs people on forensic science, many people don't know what forensic science even is. Forensic science is an important subject, many crimes cannot be solved without forensic scientists. Forensic science helps make the world a safer place.
* May clear up misinformation because many people don't know that there are scientists that help police and detectives gather and analyze evidence. Or they might not know 
* My website may get people interested in forensic science, they may want to persue that career choice.
*  
##### CONS
*
